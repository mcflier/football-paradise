## Project Overview

**Mission**: Create a lightweight, scalable sports franchise management SaaS platform for Madden leagues—positioned as a superior NeonSportz replacement.

**Key Features**:
- League setup and management
- Skill-based DFS contests with StakeKings-style backing
- AI-powered player analysis
- Real-time EA server sync
- Secure Discord login
- Stripe billing
- Multi-league scalability (1,000–10,000+ users)
- Clean, responsive UI and Twitch-style broadcast integration

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui and Radix UI for component library
- React hooks for state management
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints
- Zappa for serverless deployment
- AWS Lambda for serverless functions
- PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) for database
- Redis (AWS ElastiCache) for caching and session management

### Infrastructure & Services
- AWS: RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway
- Vercel: Frontend hosting

- GitHub: Version control and CI/CD

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Scaffold + Discord Login + Premium UI Foundation
**Objective**: Establish a secure login and a visually stunning foundation.

**Tasks**:
1. Set up frontend/ (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui)
2. Set up backend/ (FastAPI + Zappa + AWS Lambda + Redis)
3. Implement Discord OAuth2 login with session persistence
4. Protect dashboard route with middleware
5. Design a sleek login page (animated background, neon accents)

**Deliverables**:
- Login/logout via Discord (redirects to dashboard)
- Session stored in Redis with 24-hour TTL
- Protected /dashboard route (404 if unauthenticated)
- .env.template with Vercel + Lambda configs
- GitHub repo with CI (GitHub Actions lint/test)

### Phase 2: League Setup + Dashboard UI (Pro-Level Design)
**Objective**: Enable league creation with a jaw-dropping dashboard.

**Tasks**:
1. Build "Create New League" form (logo upload, name, EA creds)
2. Design dashboard: sidebar (Leagues, Teams, Players, Trades) with hover effects, main area with cards

2. Build lineup entry UI (drag-drop players)
3. Score lineups from EA stats

**Deliverables**:
- DB: contests, entries, scores

- Leaderboard component (top 5)
- Scoring logic (e.g., points = rating * 0.1)

### Phase 7: StakeKings-Style Skill Wagering (Secure + Transparent)
**Objective**: Enable staking with a pro-grade interface.

**Tasks**:
1. Build staking form (% of entry offered)
2. Create backer dashboard (available entries)
3. Calculate payouts (e.g., 80% to winner, 20% rake)
4. Integrate Stripe Payments + Connect

**Deliverables**:
- DB: stakes, backers
- Staking UI + backer view
- Payout logic with Stripe webhooks

### Phase 8: Real-Time Broadcasts (Twitch/Xbox Integration)
**Objective**: Deliver a broadcast hub rivaling Twitch.

**Tasks**:
1. Fetch Twitch streams via API (matchup-based)
2. Build "Live Games" page with embeds + chat
3. Notify via Discord webhook

**Deliverables**:
- Live stream grid (e.g., 4 games)
- Chat widget per stream
- Webhook for stream start

### Phase 9: Admin Tools + Audit Logging (Robust Oversight)
**Objective**: Ensure transparency with a clean admin UX.

2. Build admin panel (filterable logs)
3. Send Discord alerts for key events

**Deliverables**:

**Deliverables**:
- Billing page with plan cards
- DB: subscriptions, usage
- Middleware for feature gating
